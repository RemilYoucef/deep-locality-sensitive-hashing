# DeepLSH: Deep Locality-Sensitive Hash Learning for Fast and Efficient Near-Duplicate Crash Report Detection

## Overview
Automatic crash bucketing is a critical step in the software development process to efficiently analyze and triage bug reports. In this work, we aim at detecting for a crash report its candidate near-duplicates (i.e., similar crashes that are likely to be induced by the same software bug) in a large database of historical crashes and given any similarity measure dedicated to compare between stack traces. To this end, we propose **DeepLSH** a deep Siamese hash coding neural network based on Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) property in order to provide binary hash codes aiming to locate the most similar stack traces into hash buckets. **DeepLSH** have been conducted on a large stack trace dataset and performed on state-of-the-art similarity measures proposed to tackle the crash deduplication problem:

## Contributions

Our contribution is three-fold. 
- Aiming to overcome the problem of deriving LSH functions for stack-trace similarity measures, we propose a generic approach dubbed DeepLSH that learns and provides a family of binary hash functions that perfectly approximate the locality-sensitive property to retrieve efficiently and rapidly near-duplicate stack traces.

- Technically, we design a deep Siamese neural network architecture to perform end-to-end hashing with an original objective loss function based on the locality-sensitive property preserving with appropriate regularizations to cope with the binarization problem of optimizing non-smooth loss functions. 
- We demonstrate through our experimental study the effectiveness and scalability of DeepLSH to yield near-duplicate crash reports under a dozen of similarity metrics. We successfully compare to standard LSH techniques (MinHash and SimHash), and the most relevant deep hashing baselineon a large real-world dataset that we make available.
